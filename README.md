# get-started

Bootstrap script for a fresh **Ubuntu on WSL2** machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielCosme/get-started.git
cd get-started
./install.sh --list-profiles
./install.sh --profile wsl-dev
```

Everything is idempotent — re-running is safe, and anything it replaces in `$HOME`
is copied to `~/.get-started-backup/<timestamp>/` first.

## Usage

```bash
./install.sh --profile wsl-dev        # install, and remember the choice
./install.sh                          # re-run the remembered profile
./install.sh --dry-run                # show the plan, install nothing
./install.sh --list                   # show modules
./install.sh --list-profiles          # show profiles
./install.sh --skip latex             # everything but TeX Live
./install.sh --skip sudo              # keep the sudo password prompt
./install.sh --only shell,dotfiles
CLANG_VERSION=21 ./install.sh --only cpp   # pin a different LLVM release
```

`--only` and `--skip` narrow what the profile already enables; neither can turn
on a module the profile left out.

## Profiles

A profile is one bash file, `profiles/<name>.sh`, describing a whole setup:
which modules run, which identity to install, which plugins, extensions and
tools. Scenarios, not people: `wsl-dev` is a workstation, `ci-headless`
is a container. It is plain variables and arrays, sourced by `lib.sh`:

```bash
DESCRIPTION="Python, C++, Rust and Node workstation on WSL2"
MODULES=(sudo locale base shell cpp python rust docker github claude vscode
         dotfiles)
GIT_NAME="Your Name"
CLANG_VERSION=22
ZSH_PLUGINS=(git fzf zsh-bat)
CLAUDE_SETTINGS='{"model": "opus"}'
```

```bash
./install.sh --list-profiles           # what is available
./install.sh --profile wsl-dev         # install, and remember the choice
./install.sh --dry-run                 # show the plan, install nothing
./install.sh --only dotfiles           # re-run one module under that profile
./doctor.sh                            # verify the machine against the profile
```

### Adding a scenario

A profile is self-contained: one file is the whole setup. Nothing is
inherited and nothing is layered on top, so what the file says is exactly
what gets installed. Start from the closest existing profile:

```bash
cp profiles/wsl-dev.sh profiles/<name>.sh
```

Edit it, then `./install.sh --profile <name>`. A profile only needs the
variables of the modules it enables; `ci-headless` has no `CLANG_VERSION`
because it does not run `cpp`.

### Adding a module

Drop a script into `scripts/` named `NN-name.sh`. The number is the run order,
`name` is what `MODULES`, `--only` and `--skip` use, and the first two lines
are the whole contract:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-line description, shown by ./install.sh --list.
# profile: VAR_A VAR_B
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../lib.sh"
```

The `# profile:` line names the profile variables the module reads. Together
these lines are the full list of variables a profile may set.

### Checks

`./install.sh` checks the profile before it asks for sudo or installs anything:

- A variable no module reads is an error, so `CLANG_VERSON=21` fails loudly.
- Every name in `MODULES` must have a script.
- Every enabled module's `# profile:` variables must be set.
- A module run on its own (`bash scripts/20-cpp.sh`) checks its own variables
  against the remembered profile.

The environment still wins for `CLANG_VERSION` and `TIMEZONE`:
`CLANG_VERSION=21 ./install.sh --only cpp` beats whatever the profile says.

### How values reach the dotfiles

Tracked dotfiles carry no identity. The installer generates small files that
they include, so every tracked file is the same on every machine:

| Generated | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `~/.gitconfig.local` | `[include]` in `~/.gitconfig` |
| `~/.config/profile-env.zsh` | sourced by `~/.zshrc` |
| `~/.config/mise/config.toml` | mise |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code (tracked file with `CLAUDE_SETTINGS` merged over it by `jq`) |

### A machine-only profile

`profiles/local.sh` is gitignored. It is a complete profile like any other,
for setups you do not want to commit, and you select it by name:

```bash
cp profiles/wsl-dev.sh profiles/local.sh   # then edit it
./install.sh --profile local
```

### Tests

```bash
./tests/run.sh                 # shell tests, then shellcheck if installed
```

## Modules

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `sudo` | passwordless sudo via `/etc/sudoers.d/`, validated with `visudo -c` before install |

| `claude` | Claude Code CLI, `settings.json` (merged with `jq`), `statusline.py`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| `vscode` | the profile's `VSCODE_EXTENSIONS` (39 in `wsl-dev`), Machine `settings.json` |
| `dotfiles` | `.zshrc`, `.zshenv`, `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore_global`, clangd config, generated `~/.config/wsl-env.zsh` |

## Checking the result

```bash
./doctor.sh     # read-only; exits non-zero if anything is missing
```

Verifies every module's deliverables — versions, group membership, the sudoers
drop-in, cloned zsh plugins, clang major version, `run-clang-tidy` on `PATH`,
docker reachability, SSH authentication to GitHub, and the git settings below.

## WSL interop paths

The `cube` and `cmonitor` aliases and `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS_PATH` point into the
Windows user profile, whose name differs per machine. Rather than hardcode it,
the `dotfiles` module detects it at install time and writes:

```sh
# ~/.config/wsl-env.zsh
export WIN_USER="<detected>"
export WIN_HOME="/mnt/c/Users/<detected>"
```

`.zshrc` sources that file if it exists and defines the Windows-facing aliases
inside the guard, so on a non-WSL machine the block is simply skipped.

Detection tries `cmd.exe` (~65 ms), then `powershell.exe` (~350 ms), then falls
back to the single non-system profile under `/mnt/c/Users`. It runs **once, in
the installer** — shell startup only does a file test and a `source`, never a
subprocess. Re-run it with `./install.sh --only dotfiles`.

## Git configuration

`dotfiles/.gitconfig` carries no identity at all — that comes from the profile
via `~/.gitconfig.local`. What it does carry:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `push.autoSetupRemote` | `git push` on a new branch just works, no `--set-upstream` |
| `pull.rebase` | rebase instead of creating merge bubbles |
| `fetch.prune` | delete refs for branches gone from the remote |
| `rebase.autoStash` | rebase with a dirty tree instead of refusing |
| `merge.conflictStyle = zdiff3` | conflicts show the common ancestor, not just the two sides |
| `rerere.enabled` | remember a conflict resolution and replay it |
| `diff.algorithm = histogram` | noticeably better diffs than the default |
| `core.autocrlf = input` | normalise CRLF on commit, never on checkout |
| `branch.sort = -committerdate` | `git branch` lists most recent first |
| `core.excludesfile` | points at `~/.gitignore_global` |

These live in the dotfile rather than in a module that runs `git config --global`,
because the `dotfiles` module runs last and would overwrite anything such a
module had written.

## Passwordless sudo

The `sudo` module writes `/etc/sudoers.d/99-<user>-nopasswd`, validated with
`visudo -c` before it is installed — an invalid sudoers file would otherwise lock
you out of `sudo` entirely. Any process running as you can then become root with
no prompt, which is the trade-off. Skip it with `./install.sh --skip sudo`.

## Secrets — not in this repo

- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` — the `github` module generates a fresh key per machine.
- `gh` and Claude Code credentials — authenticate interactively after install.

## Version caveats

- **Docker** may not publish a pocket for a brand-new Ubuntu release on day one.
  The `docker` module detects this and falls back to `noble`; re-run
  `./install.sh --only docker` once the real pocket exists.
- **`eza`** is installed from the Ubuntu archive when available, and from
  `deb.gierens.de` otherwise.
- **`bat`** is `batcat` on Ubuntu. The `zsh-bat` plugin aliases `cat` -> `batcat`
  (the real one stays available as `rcat`) and routes man pages through it; the
  `base` module additionally symlinks `~/.local/bin/bat` so a plain `bat` command
  works in bash and in non-interactive shells.
- **clang 22** comes from `apt.llvm.org`. The module probes for a pocket matching
  the release codename and falls back to `noble` if LLVM has not published one
  yet. `clang-format` output changes between major versions, so re-running
  `make format` on a project last formatted with clang-format 18 will produce a
  diff — expect one commit of churn per project.
- **`gcc-arm-none-eabi`** tracks the Ubuntu archive, so its version moves with the
  release (24.04 shipped 13.2.rel1). Pin it manually from the Arm Developer site
  if a firmware project requires a specific toolchain.

## After installing

1. `exec zsh`, or reopen the terminal.
2. `wsl --shutdown` from Windows — group membership (`docker`, `dialout`,
   `plugdev`) and systemd only take effect after a full restart.
3. `gh auth login` and `claude` to authenticate.
4. Nothing on the Windows side is managed here — Windows Terminal and the
   VS Code UI use fonts installed on Windows, which is a one-time manual step.
5. If VS Code extensions were skipped, connect VS Code to WSL once and re-run
   `./install.sh --only vscode`.

## Updating this repo from a live machine

After changing `~/.zshrc` and friends, copy them back and commit:

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshenv ~/.gitconfig dotfiles/
cp ~/.config/clangd/config.yaml dotfiles/.config/clangd/
cp ~/.claude/{settings.json,statusline.py,CLAUDE.md} dotfiles/.claude/
cp ~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json dotfiles/vscode/
```

For VS Code extensions, `code --list-extensions` gives the list to paste into
the profile's `VSCODE_EXTENSIONS`.
